This directory contains the React implementation of the test application used in the thesis: "Comparison of Modern Frontend Frameworks: React, Svelte, and Qwik".

The application is implemented as a client-side single-page application using a component-based architecture and explicit state management.
It serves as one implementation of an identical notes application also developed using Svelte and Qwik.

The React version provides the following functionality:
- creation, editing, and deletion of notes
- keyword-based search across note titles and content
- tag-based filtering
- client-side data persistence using browser storage

The React application is built using Node.js and a modern frontend build tool. To run the application locally, the following requirements and steps are needed:
- Node.js (version 18 or newer recommended)
- npm (included with Node.js)
- From the root of the repository, navigate to the React implementation directory and install the project dependencies and run it

npm install
npm run dev
