# react-svelte-qwik

This repository contains the test application used in the thesis "Comparison of Modern Frontend Frameworks".

The same notes application is implemented using:
- React
- Svelte
- Qwik

Each implementation provides identical functionality and as close as possible a layout to allow a fair comparison of framework behaviour.

Structure
- /react: React implementation
